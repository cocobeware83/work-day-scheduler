## Usage
* This is a simple application to assist with workday organization.  The user can enter tasks they wish to accomplish hour-by-hour within the span of a typical work day.  The application will keep track of your saved tasks, and warn you with color coded blocks when your tasks are drawing near to their deadline. This application can be used over and over, as the timeblocks can be cleared and reused daily.
